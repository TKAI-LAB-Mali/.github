# Welcome to the TKAI Lab

At the Trustworthy Knowledge-Driven Artificial Intelligence (TKAI) Lab, we
combine research ideas derived from formal methods, linguistics, cognitive
science, and machine learning to efficiently build intelligent systems that are
trustworthy, ethical, and secure. These models should have properties such as
robustness and interpretability, such that humans can easily understand the
generated information. This would mean designing agents that are expected to
learn desirable behavior with minimal supervision/data that are provably stable
and generalize to unseen distributions. We believe these objectives can be
stably achieved by designing knowledge-guided neuro-symbolic agents.
